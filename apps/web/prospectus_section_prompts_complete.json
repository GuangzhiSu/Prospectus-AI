      "content": "Purpose & format\n\nThis section should present a clear timeline of key events and dates for the offering process.\n\nThe information is typically formatted as a list or table of milestones (with times and dates) in chronological order.\n\nWhat must be listed\n\nFor example, it should list when the public offering opens and closes, the pricing/allocation announcement date, refund and share certificate dispatch dates, and the expected listing date.\n\nEvery event entry must include the specific date and local time it occurs to ensure precision.\n\nRequired precision & standard notes\n\nA standard feature is a cautionary note that if the schedule changes, the company will issue an official announcement to notify investors.\n\nThe content’s granularity is exact – including specific times (e.g. “9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, December 1, 2020”) and the full date for each step.\n\nLanguage & additional explanations\n\nThe language should be factual and concise, directly informing investors of when each crucial step of the offering will take place.\n\nFootnotes may be used for additional explanation (for instance, to explain any contingencies or adjustments to the timetable).\n\nInvestor value\n\nBy providing a precise and complete schedule of the offering in an easy-to-scan format, this section ensures investors know all important deadlines and events in the IPO process."

      "content": "Core function\n\nIn the Contents section, the prospectus provides a structured table of contents mapping out all chapters, sections, and appendices along with their corresponding page numbers.\n\nOutput requirements\n\nThe AI should generate this as an ordered list of section titles exactly as they appear (e.g. “SUMMARY – Page 1”, “RISK FACTORS – Page 44”, etc.), mirroring the official format.\n\nEach entry should align with the actual titles and page numbering of the prospectus.\n\nCoverage & granularity\n\nThe information framework is straightforward: it includes every major heading and sub-heading (often down to second-level headings) in the document, in sequence.\n\nThe standard content range covers all sections from the front of the prospectus through the appendices, giving readers an overview of the document’s structure.\n\nInformation granularity here means including every relevant heading and its page, ensuring no section is omitted.\n\nExamples of included headings\n\nFor example, the contents should list sections like “Summary”, “Definitions”, “Risk Factors”, “Business”, “Financial Information”, etc., each with the page number where that section begins.\n\nFormatting expectations\n\nThe AI’s output should exactly reflect the final document’s sectional breakdown, maintaining the formatting (often leaders or dot lines connecting section titles to page numbers) for a professional, compliant appearance."

      "section": "Summary",
      "content": "Role of the section\n\nThe Summary section provides a high-level overview of the company and the offering, condensing critical information for a quick read.\n\nStructure & required elements\n\nThe AI should structure this as a narrative that touches on all essential points: a brief introduction to the company’s business and industry, key financial figures, major strengths, strategies, and significant risks, as well as basic details of the offering.\n\nIt should begin with a statement of purpose (e.g. “This summary aims to give you an overview of the information contained in this prospectus... You should read the entire document before making any investment decision”) to remind readers that it’s only a synopsis.\n\nScope and content range\n\nThe content range must cover the company’s core business model and market position in a few sentences, highlight revenue/profit trends or other important financial metrics, and mention any distinctive aspects (for instance, the presence of a unique selling point or competitive advantage).\n\nIt should include summarized financial information, often in table form, for the track record period (e.g. summary of income statements, balance sheets, and cash flows) to give investors a snapshot of performance.\n\nThe summary also typically outlines a few material risk factors in brief, alerting investors to key risks (with a cross-reference to the Risk Factors section).\n\nIf applicable\n\nIf applicable, it should note recent developments (such as significant post-period events or industry changes that affect the company) and the expected impact.\n\nTone & level of detail\n\nAll information should be presented in a balanced, factual tone without marketing hype, and with enough granularity that an investor gains a solid understanding of the company’s profile and the offering terms – but not so detailed that it overwhelms (each point is concise, since fuller details appear in later sections).\n\nOverall purpose\n\nEssentially, this section acts as an informative “executive summary” of the prospectus, covering business overview, financial highlights, key risks, and offering details in a structured, reader-friendly manner."

      "section": "Definitions",
      "content": "What it is\n\nThe Definitions section is a comprehensive glossary of defined terms used throughout the prospectus.\n\nRequired format\n\nThe AI should output it as an alphabetical list of terms, each followed by a clear definition.\n\nThe information framework is essentially a dictionary-style format: term on the left (often in quotation marks or bold), and its meaning on the right.\n\nWhat gets defined\n\nFor example, it will define the company name (e.g. “Company Name” means the issuer and its subsidiaries), technical abbreviations, names of significant entities, and other repeated phrases.\n\nStandard content includes names of key people (“Mr. X” – followed by the person’s full name and title), company entities, regulatory authorities, industry terms, abbreviations for financial or legal terms, and any other jargon or short-form that appears in the document.\n\nAccuracy & completeness\n\nEach definition should be accurate and succinct, capturing the essence (for instance, defining “PRC” as “the People’s Republic of China, excluding for the purpose of this prospectus Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan”).\n\nThe granularity requirement is that every significant term that could be unfamiliar or have a specific meaning in the context of this company/industry is included, to ensure the prospectus is self-contained in clarity.\n\nThe AI’s output should maintain the exact phrasing used in the prospectus for consistency and legal precision.\n\nStyle note\n\nThis section does not use narrative sentences, but rather a list format with each term’s definition separated, enabling readers to easily look up meanings of terms as they proceed through the document."

      "section": "Glossary of Technical Terms",
      "content": "How it differs from Definitions\n\nThis section resembles the Definitions section but focuses on industry- or technical-specific terminology that a general investor might not know.\n\nRequired format & tone\n\nThe AI should produce an alphabetized list of technical terms or acronyms, each with a brief explanation.\n\nThe information framework is similar to a glossary entry: term followed by a one-line or short paragraph definition explaining it in plain language.\n\nThe tone is factual and explanatory.\n\nContent scope & examples\n\nThe content scope covers jargon, scientific or product terms, and industry-specific concepts related to the company’s business.\n\nFor example, in a technology company’s prospectus this might include definitions of technical standards or in a biotech prospectus, definitions of medical terms.\n\nIn the case of Pop Mart, terms related to pop culture toys and IP might be included (e.g. definitions of “IP” in the context of Intellectual Property characters, or specific product category names).\n\nGranularity & consistency\n\nThe granularity should be enough to give a reader basic understanding of each term – not a full essay, just a concise clarification.\n\nThe AI should ensure consistency with how these terms are later used in the Business or Industry sections.\n\nFor instance, if “blind box” or “pop toy” is a technical term, it should be defined (e.g. “Pop toys – toys infused with pop culture and trendy content, often sold in blind boxes”).\n\nWhy it matters\n\nBy including this section, the prospectus ensures that all readers, regardless of background, can understand specialized terms used in describing the business and its industry."

      "section": "Forward-Looking Statements",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThe Forward-Looking Statements section is a cautionary disclaimer explaining that certain statements in the prospectus are predictive or based on future expectations.\n\nDrafting requirements\n\nThe AI should draft this in formal, legal language, making clear that any statements about future plans, prospects, or performance are not guarantees.\n\nThe content typically states that forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and information currently available to the company, which may prove to be inaccurate.\n\nWhat must be covered\n\nIt should enumerate the kinds of statements that qualify (e.g. those regarding future growth, market demand, expansion plans, financial projections) and then warn that actual results could differ materially due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties.\n\nA standard phrase would be that investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\nTiming & updating\n\nThe section also often mentions that all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the prospectus, and the company undertakes no obligation to update them unless required by law.\n\nTypical structure\n\nThe information framework is generally a few cautionary paragraphs – starting by identifying forward-looking statements, then highlighting risk factors that could cause outcomes to differ, and ending with the qualification that the statements are expressly qualified by these cautionary notes.\n\nGranularity level\n\nThe granularity is moderate: it doesn’t list every risk (since the Risk Factors section does that), but it provides enough examples of uncertainties (macroeconomic conditions, competition, regulatory changes, etc.) that could impact forward-looking information.\n\nCompliance emphasis\n\nThe AI’s language should be highly precise and compliant, often mirroring standard safe-harbor disclaimers.\n\nEssentially, this section serves to legally protect the company by alerting readers that predictions are subject to change and should be viewed with caution."

    {
      "section": "Risk Factors",
      "content": "Role and tone\n\nThe Risk Factors section contains a detailed discussion of all significant risks associated with the company’s business and the investment, written in a frank and thorough manner.\n\nStructure\n\nThe AI should structure this as a series of sub-sections or bullet points (usually formatted as descriptive sub-headings with explanatory paragraphs) for each major risk.\n\nCoverage requirements\n\nThe content range must be comprehensive: covering industry-related risks, business and operational risks, financial and market risks, regulatory and legal risks, and any investment-specific risks (such as risks related to the offering structure or share price volatility).\n\nPer-risk content\n\nEach risk factor typically has a heading that states the risk in a crisp statement, followed by one or more paragraphs explaining why this is a risk and how it could adversely affect the company or investors.\n\nFor example, a risk factor heading might be, “We cannot assure you that our pop culture products will continue to be popular, and a decline in consumer interest could adversely affect our sales,” followed by details supporting that statement.\n\nThe AI’s output for each risk should include the context or cause of the risk, the potential negative outcome (impact on revenue, profit, reputation, regulatory compliance, etc.), and sometimes mitigating factors or the company’s response (though usually emphasis is on the downside).\n\nOrganization\n\nThe information framework is often grouped by type of risk, starting with those relating to the business/industry, then financial matters, then regulatory environment, and finally risks relating to the shares or the offering.\n\nGranularity\n\nThe granularity requirement is high: this section should err on the side of full disclosure, meaning each risk is described with sufficient detail and specific examples or figures (if relevant) to convey its seriousness.\n\nFor instance, if the company is heavily dependent on one product or one market, the risk factor will quantify that dependence and describe consequences of its change.\n\nCompliance requirements\n\nThe tone remains cautionary and factual, avoiding optimistic language.\n\nIt’s important the AI agent does not downplay any risk – compliance standards require that all material risks be clearly disclosed.\n\nInvestor value\n\nBy structuring the risk factors with clear headings and in-depth explanation, the AI’s output will ensure investors are well-informed of potential downsides before making an investment decision."

      "section": "Waivers from Strict Compliance with Listing Rules (Waivers and Exemptions)",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nIn this section, the prospectus discloses any special dispensations the company has obtained from the stock exchange or regulators regarding listing requirements.\n\nHow to structure\n\nThe AI should enumerate each waiver or exemption the company sought, usually structured by the specific rule waived.\n\nRequired components for each waiver\n\nThe standard content includes a brief description of the requirement from which the company is exempted, the justification for seeking the waiver, and confirmation that the exchange or regulator granted it.\n\nExample pattern\n\nFor example, a common waiver in Hong Kong IPOs is for management presence in Hong Kong (if most directors reside outside Hong Kong) – the prospectus would explain this rule (Listing Rule X.Y requiring certain executives to reside in HK) and why the company cannot meet it, then note that a waiver was granted subject to conditions.\n\nGranularity & rule referencing\n\nEach waiver is typically presented as a sub-section with a heading (often the topic, like “Management Presence in Hong Kong”) followed by paragraphs detailing the situation.\n\nThe AI’s output should provide the reason for each waiver (e.g., “due to the Company’s operations being primarily in the PRC, all executive Directors are based in the PRC, making strict compliance with the Hong Kong residency requirement impracticable”) and any conditions attached to the waiver (such as appointing a Hong Kong communication agent as an alternative measure).\n\nThe information framework is factual and itemized; it may reference the exact Listing Rule numbers and their titles.\n\nThe granularity is specific – it should cite the rule number and title, describe the extent of non-compliance, and the mitigation or alternative steps the company is taking due to the waiver.\n\nTransparency & edge cases\n\nThis section ensures transparency about regulatory compliance: investors learn that the company does not fully meet certain standard rules but has obtained official permission to proceed anyway.\n\nThe AI must ensure the explanation is clear that without these waivers, the company would not meet listing criteria, but with them, the listing is permitted.\n\nClarity and completeness in describing waivers (including any that were sought but not granted, if applicable) is crucial for compliance."

      "section": "Information about this Prospectus and the Global Offering",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThis section provides important notices to investors on how to interpret the document and details about the offering process.\n\nFormat\n\nThe AI should write it as a series of informational points or short paragraphs.\n\nStandard content that must appear\n\nStandard content includes: distribution and reliance – a statement that the prospectus is the only authorized source of information and that no one is authorized to provide different information (investors should not rely on any other sources).\n\nIt often clarifies that the prospectus does not constitute an offer in any jurisdiction where it’s not permitted, cautioning investors regarding the distribution of the document across borders.\n\nOffering mechanics references\n\nIt also discloses arrangements for the offering, such as how the shares will be delivered and traded.\n\nFor example, in a Hong Kong offering, it would mention that the shares will be listed on HKEX and that they will be admitted into CCASS (the Central Clearing and Settlement System) – indicating clearing and settlement arrangements.\n\nThe section might mention the procedures for the Hong Kong Public Offering vs. international tranche in broad terms, or refer to where those details are found.\n\nCurrency and exchange rate disclosure\n\nAnother key element is currency and exchange rate information: the prospectus usually states the exchange rate assumptions used for any conversions (e.g., amounts in USD have been converted to HKD at a specified rate for illustration).\n\nThe AI should include a note on exchange rate conversion if the document contains figures in multiple currencies, ensuring investors understand how foreign currency amounts are translated.\n\nOther possible notices\n\nAdditionally, any references to legal registration of the prospectus (such as it having been registered with the Companies Registry) or the availability of the document (website info, etc.) might be mentioned.\n\nGranularity and legal responsibility\n\nThe granularity here is moderate: each point should be clear and not overly detailed, since this is largely a reference section.\n\nBut it must not omit any standard notice or legal requirement – for instance, statements about the responsibility of directors for the contents of the prospectus (directors collectively accept responsibility for accuracy) often appear around here or in a similar introductory section.\n\nTone & investor value\n\nThe tone remains formal and explanatory.\n\nBy covering how to use the prospectus, legal notices, and key offering arrangements, this section guides investors in understanding the context and validity of the information presented."

      "section": "Directors and Parties Involved in the Global Offering",
      "content": "Purpose & format\n\nThis section lists the key individuals and firms involved in the IPO.\n\nThe AI should format this as a directory of names and roles.\n\nOverall framework\n\nThe content framework is typically divided into two parts: the Company’s directors and senior management, and the professional advisors/parties.\n\nDirectors and their details\n\nFirst, it names the directors of the company (often with their titles).\n\nIn Hong Kong prospectuses, this may include a table with columns for Name, Address, and Nationality of each director.\n\nTransaction parties\n\nRight after directors, it may list the Joint Sponsors, Global Coordinators, Bookrunners, and Lead Managers, naming each investment bank involved in those underwriting roles.\n\nThen it includes other professional parties: the legal advisors (Hong Kong counsel, international counsel, PRC counsel – naming the law firms), the auditors/reporting accountants, valuers (if any), and other experts.\n\nPer-entry requirements\n\nEach entry should include the name of the firm or person and their role or capacity.\n\nFor example, “Auditor and Reporting Accountant: XYZ & Co., Certified Public Accountants”.\n\nAddresses and completeness\n\nIt also provides addresses for some parties, such as the company’s registered address (which might also appear in the Corporate Information section) and often the addresses of the sponsors or auditors.\n\nThe granularity is literal here: every significant party to the offering must be named exactly as in official records.\n\nThe AI’s output should ensure no party is omitted (including any compliance adviser, receiving bankers, share registrars, etc., if they are listed in this section of the template prospectus).\n\nStyle & accuracy\n\nThe style is a straightforward listing, possibly using indentation or table format to clearly distinguish categories (e.g., Directors vs. Other Parties).\n\nAccuracy in spelling of names and inclusion of any professional qualifications (like “FCPA” for accountants, or law firm designations) is important.\n\nNo narrative\n\nThis section does not narrate, but rather serves as a who’s who directory for the transaction.\n\nIt assures readers that all key players in the IPO process are disclosed, as required."

    {
      "section": "Corporate Information",
      "content": "What it is\n\nThe Corporate Information section provides basic data about the company’s corporate and contact details.\n\nFormat\n\nThe AI should output this as a concise reference block.\n\nTypical content (must include as applicable)\n\nIt typically includes: Registered office (usually an address in the company’s jurisdiction of incorporation), Headquarters or principal executive office (if different, often an address in the company’s main place of business), Company’s website, Company Secretary (name of the company secretary), Authorized Representatives (names of individuals who act as liaisons with the stock exchange), and Compliance Advisor (if one is appointed for post-listing compliance, usually a financial firm’s name).\n\nIt also names the Hong Kong share registrar (with address) if the company is listing in HK, and any other share registrars for other jurisdictions if applicable.\n\nAdditionally, basic corporate particulars like the company’s date of incorporation and company number may be included, as well as the stock code (once assigned).\n\nExample style\n\nThe standard content range is factual and formal.\n\nFor example, it would state, “Registered Office: 3-212 Governors Square, 23 Lime Tree Bay Avenue, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands”, “Company’s principal place of business in Hong Kong: [address]”, “Company website: www.xyz.com”, etc.\n\nGranularity & formatting\n\nThe granularity is specific: every key contact detail should be present.\n\nThis section usually does not have sentences, but a list of labels and information.\n\nThe AI should ensure formatting is neat (each piece of info on a separate line or separated by semicolons), making it easy for a reader to find these details at a glance.\n\nValue\n\nBy compiling all fundamental corporate contacts and references here, the prospectus provides investors and regulatory readers with quick access to such information without searching through the document."

    {
      "section": "Regulation (Regulatory Overview)",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThe Regulation section (sometimes titled “Regulatory Overview”) summarizes the key laws and regulations that govern the company’s business and industry.\n\nStructure\n\nThe AI agent should structure this in a logical, thematic order, breaking it down by categories of regulations.\n\nExamples of categories\n\nFor instance, if the company is in retail and online services (like Pop Mart), the categories might include Licensing for Online Services, Consumer Protection Laws, Intellectual Property Laws, Environmental and Safety Regulations, Foreign Investment Restrictions, etc.\n\nWhat must be covered\n\nEach category should have a brief description of the relevant rules.\n\nThe content needs to cover what permits or approvals are required for the business, what ongoing compliance standards exist, and recent regulatory developments if any.\n\nIllustrative regulatory logic\n\nFor example, if a company operates an internet platform in China, the overview would mention the laws on Internet content provision and online culture services, noting that PRC law prohibits foreign ownership of such services, which is why the company uses a VIE (contractual arrangements).\n\nIt might outline the legal basis of those restrictions (e.g., reference the PRC Foreign Investment Negative List) and how the company complies (through local subsidiaries or contracts).\n\nHow to describe rules\n\nFor advertising or product safety, it will cite the key legislation like the Advertising Law or product quality standards, summarizing requirements (e.g., “No advertisement shall contain false or misleading information” as per the PRC Advertising Law).\n\nGranularity & risk signaling\n\nThe granularity should be enough to inform investors of the regulatory environment risk and compliance: each mentioned law should include its name and a short explanation of its scope or what it requires/prohibits.\n\nIf there are specific regulatory risks (e.g., laws that might change or are particularly stringent), this section may foreshadow them (though detailed consequences often appear in Risk Factors).\n\nLicenses and status\n\nIt may also note if the company has all necessary licenses as of the Latest Practicable Date, or if certain applications are pending, since that is material information.\n\nTone & outcome\n\nThe AI’s tone should be neutral and informative, as this is a factual overview.\n\nEssentially, this section frames the legal landscape the company operates in, giving readers context on how government policies and regulations could affect the business and what the company must adhere to."

    {
      "section": "Industry Overview",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThe Industry Overview provides background on the market or industry in which the company operates, often supported by third-party research.\n\nRequired sub-parts\n\nThe AI should divide this section into sub-parts that cover: definition of the industry, market size and growth trends, competitive landscape, and possibly future outlook.\n\nTypical flow\n\nIt usually begins by defining key terms or segments of the industry (for example, explaining what “pop toys” are in Pop Mart’s case, as per an industry definition).\n\nThen it presents data on the industry’s historical and projected market size, typically including figures and compound annual growth rates, sourced from an independent market research firm.\n\nSource attribution\n\nThe AI must cite such data as coming from sources like Frost & Sullivan or other consultants, as the prospectus does (e.g., “according to the Frost & Sullivan Report, the market size of China’s pop toy retailing was RMBX in 2019 and is expected to reach RMBY by 2024”).\n\nCoverage expectations\n\nThe content range should cover both global context (if relevant) and the specific region of the company (e.g., the Chinese market for a Chinese issuer), highlighting drivers of growth or recent trends (such as increasing disposable incomes, urbanization, consumer preferences for certain products).\n\nCompetition discussion\n\nAdditionally, the competitive landscape is described: how fragmented or consolidated the industry is, the company’s rank or market share if available, and key competitors (with possibly a statement like “the top five players accounted for X% of the market, with Company ranked first at 8.5% share”).\n\nOther influencing factors\n\nIf the industry is influenced by government policy or technological change, those factors are outlined as well.\n\nGranularity & presentation\n\nThe granularity involves specific statistics and rankings, growth percentages, and qualitative analysis of trends.\n\nThe AI’s language should remain objective and analytic, not promotional – this section is about the industry, not the company specifically.\n\nThe use of charts or tables is common, although if only text is being generated, the AI should describe any notable figures clearly in prose.\n\nClosing outlook\n\nIt may end with a short outlook discussing how the industry is expected to evolve in the next few years (again citing the research source for any forecasts).\n\nInvestor value\n\nBy thoroughly covering the industry context, this section helps investors understand the broader environment and opportunity set that the company operates within."

      "section": "History, Reorganization, and Corporate Structure",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThis section outlines the company’s background and how it came to its current form.\n\nChronological history\n\nThe AI’s output should chronologically narrate the company’s key milestones since inception: the founding date, important business milestones (product launches, expansions, any major awards or achievements), and changes in corporate structure.\n\nReorganization for IPO\n\nA major component is describing the reorganization steps undertaken to prepare for the IPO.\n\nIn many cases, companies restructure shareholdings or set up holding companies prior to listing.\n\nThe AI should explain these transactions in simple terms – for example, “in [month year], the Company underwent a reorganization whereby a new Cayman Islands holding company (the issuer) was incorporated to become the listing vehicle, and the equity interests of the operating subsidiaries were transferred under this holding structure.”\n\nOther structural events\n\nAny mergers, spinoffs, or capital changes as part of the reorganization should be noted.\n\nIf there were significant pre-IPO investments (like series funding rounds by investors), this section might briefly mention those and how they affected ownership.\n\nCorporate structure description\n\nThe Corporate Structure part usually includes one or more diagrams or descriptions of the group’s legal entities.\n\nThe AI should describe the group structure, stating the main subsidiaries and their ownership.\n\nFor example: “The following diagram illustrates our corporate and shareholding structure immediately before and after the Global Offering…”.\n\nPre- and post-IPO structure\n\nIt should list the key subsidiaries, their jurisdictions, and percentage ownership.\n\nIf the prospectus provides two structures (pre-IPO and post-IPO), the AI should explain both: who the major shareholders were before listing and how that changes after listing (e.g., after issuing new shares in the IPO and executing any Capitalization Issue or stock split).\n\nGranularity\n\nThe granularity should include names of major subsidiaries and intermediate holding companies, especially any material operating entities, and any VIE (contractual arrangement) entities if those exist (though details of VIE go in another section).\n\nOutcome\n\nEssentially, by the end of this section, a reader should understand the lineage and evolution of the company and see a clear picture of the group’s makeup.\n\nIllustrative detail that should be captured if present\n\nThis might involve stating “Our company was founded in [year] by [Founder’s Name] in [city]” and then describing growth (e.g., opened first store in 2010, expanded to X cities by 2015, etc.), culminating in the steps taken in the last year to reorganize for the IPO.\n\nTone and diagram handling\n\nThe AI’s tone remains factual and chronological.\n\nDiagrams themselves can be described in text if needed (e.g., “See chart below for corporate structure”), but primarily the agent should ensure all pieces of the corporate puzzle are mentioned in text form: significant entities, founders, investor stakes, and any noteworthy structural notes (like dual-class shares if any, or WVR beneficiaries if relevant).\n\nConsistency with what’s shown in any accompanying diagram is critical."

      "section": "Business",
      "content": "Overall role\n\nThe Business section is one of the longest and most detailed parts of the prospectus, giving investors a deep dive into the company’s operations and strategies.\n\nThe AI should organize this section into subsections covering all aspects of the business.\n\nCore subsections to include\n\nKey elements to include are: Business Overview, Products and Services, Business Model, Sales and Marketing, Operations, Technology, Competitive Strengths, Growth Strategies, Intellectual Property, Employees, Properties, and Environmental/Social/Legal Compliance related to operations.\n\nOpening overview\n\nIt often begins with a general overview paragraph summing up what the company does and its position in the industry (e.g., “We are the largest and fastest-growing pop toy company in China, specializing in the design and sale of trendy collectible figurines.”).\n\nProducts and development\n\nThe AI should then delve into product lines or services: describing the main categories of products, the brands or IPs involved, and how the company develops them (for instance, an outline of the process of product design and collaboration with artists, since Pop Mart’s business involves IP collaborations).\n\nBusiness model and revenue streams\n\nNext, it should describe the business model and revenue streams – how the company makes money.\n\nFor a retail company like Pop Mart, this includes an explanation of sales channels (own retail stores, online store, vending machine “roboshops”, wholesale to distributors, etc.) and their relative importance.\n\nThe AI should highlight the number of outlets or presence (e.g., “As of June 30, 2020, we operated X flagship stores and Y roboshops, and had a distribution network covering 21 countries.”).\n\nCompetitive strengths\n\nThen, competitive strengths: although not explicitly labeled in the contents for Pop Mart, prospectuses typically discuss why the company is successful – e.g., strong brand community (millions of registered members), integrated platform from IP creation to retail, etc.\n\nThe AI should enumerate these strengths in a persuasive but factual tone, as subheadings or bold lead-ins, supported by facts (like community size, market share, unique model).\n\nGrowth strategies\n\nGrowth strategies usually follow, detailing how the company plans to expand – for example, international expansion, new product lines, more stores, digital initiatives, etc., showing a forward-looking plan (without making it a forward-looking statement – phrasing should be like “we intend to…”).\n\nOperations\n\nThe Business section should also cover operational details: supply chain and manufacturing (does the company produce in-house or outsource? key suppliers, production capacity, quality control measures), logistics (how products are distributed), and inventory management.\n\nAny seasonal fluctuation or backlog issues could be mentioned if relevant.\n\nMarketing & customer engagement\n\nMarketing and customer engagement is another area – e.g., description of membership programs, fan events (Pop Mart hosts toy conventions, etc.), social media presence (number of followers, app users).\n\nThe AI should mention these tangible metrics to illustrate how the company engages its customers.\n\nIntellectual property\n\nIntellectual Property: if the business relies on IP (own IP or licensed IP), detail how IP is acquired or licensed, how many proprietary characters the company has, and IP protection measures.\n\nCompetition positioning\n\nCompetition: identify main competitors and on what basis the company competes (price, product uniqueness, brand, etc. – some of this info may have been in Industry section, but here it can be tailored to the company’s perspective).\n\nOperational regulatory compliance\n\nRegulatory compliance in operations: e.g., if there are specific regulations like safety standards or online sales laws, state that the company has obtained required licenses (with specifics, such as any license numbers or regulatory approvals if important).\n\nPeople, assets, and risk management\n\nEmployees and training: number of employees, how critical human capital is, maybe mention any specialized teams (like design team, R&D team).\n\nProperties: list of principal properties like office headquarters, warehouses, etc., including if they are leased or owned.\n\nInsurance: mention coverage (e.g., “we maintain insurance policies including product liability, property insurance, etc., in line with industry practice”).\n\nGranularity expectation\n\nThroughout, the granularity is high: this section is meant to be very informative.\n\nThe AI should include concrete numbers and examples wherever possible (store counts, user counts, years of experience, etc.), drawn from the prospectus data.\n\nIllustrative metrics and unique components\n\nFor instance, including specific membership numbers (“3.6 million registered members as of June 30, 2020”), or distribution footprint (“21 overseas countries and regions”).\n\nIt should also incorporate any unique business components – e.g., for Pop Mart, mention the concept of “blind boxes” and how they drive consumer excitement, and the use of data analytics or “big data and AI technologies” to track customer preferences.\n\nTone\n\nThe tone is descriptive and confident, but not promotional; it should showcase the business in a positive light by highlighting strengths and achievements, yet remain grounded in factual statements (since everything must be supportable).\n\nUsing present tense for current operations and past tense for history is appropriate, and occasionally future tense for planned strategies.\n\nOutcome\n\nBy thoroughly covering who the company is, what it does, how it does it, and why it believes it can succeed, this section provides investors with a foundation to evaluate the company’s commercial viability."

      "section": "Contractual Arrangements (Variable Interest Entities)",
      "content": "When this section appears\n\nIf the company operates through a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure due to foreign investment restrictions (common for Chinese issuers in restricted sectors), this dedicated section explains those arrangements.\n\nOpening explanation\n\nThe AI should begin by stating why contractual arrangements are needed: which part of the business cannot be directly owned by the listing entity due to regulations.\n\nFor example, “We launched Paqu Huyu, our online platform for pop toy culture services, which is subject to PRC laws restricting foreign ownership of internet content service providers. As a result, we conduct that portion of our business through contractual arrangements with a domestic entity”.\n\nStructure description\n\nIt should then describe the structure: name the wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE) that the company owns, the operating company (VIE) held by PRC nationals (often founders or designees), and state that a series of contracts between them confer control and economic benefits of the VIE to the listed group.\n\nAgreements that must be covered\n\nThe information framework must detail each major agreement in the VIE structure: typically, (i) Exclusive Business Cooperation/Service Agreement (for transferring fees), (ii) Equity Pledge Agreement (securing the VIE owners’ shares to the WFOE), (iii) Exclusive Option Agreement (WFOE’s right to acquire the VIE equity), (iv) Powers of Attorney or Shareholders’ Voting Proxy (authorizing WFOE/its designee to exercise voting rights of the VIE’s shareholders).\n\nThe AI should summarize what each of these contracts does.\n\nIllustrative explanation\n\nFor instance: “Under the Exclusive Option Agreement, the WFOE has the right to purchase all or part of the equity interests in the VIE at a nominal price, when permitted by Chinese law.”\n\nConsolidation and diagrams\n\nIt should also mention that through these contracts, the company is able to consolidate the VIE’s results in its financial statements as if it were a subsidiary.\n\nA diagram is often used in the prospectus; the AI can describe it textually, e.g., “(See diagram illustrating the flow of control: our WFOE, Beijing Pop Mart, has contracts with Paqu Huyu and its shareholders that give us effective control and allow transfer of profits to our Group.)”\n\nRisk acknowledgment\n\nThe section must also candidly highlight the risks of this arrangement (though detailed risks appear in Risk Factors, here a brief mention is good): e.g., that the contracts may not be as effective as direct ownership and that if the VIE shareholders fail to perform their obligations or if PRC authorities found the setup illegal, the company’s business could be materially affected.\n\nIt should reference that investors are buying shares of the Cayman entity which does not directly own the restricted business assets.\n\nLegal opinions\n\nAdditionally, it should confirm whether the company’s PRC legal counsel has advised that these contracts are valid and enforceable under PRC law (this is usually stated, albeit with the caveat of uncertainties in enforcement).\n\nGranularity requirements\n\nGranularity is important: list the actual names of the entities involved (WFOE name, VIE name) and the specific contracts.\n\nIf there are any unique terms or arrangements (like arrangements to ensure the VIE’s profits get transferred as fees or loans), describe those.\n\nAlso, mention any regulatory approval or filing of these agreements if applicable.\n\nClarity for non-specialist investors\n\nThe AI should ensure the explanation remains clear to an investor who may not be familiar with VIE structures – essentially conveying that “although we don’t legally own part of our business, we control it via contracts”.\n\nTone and compliance\n\nThis section is crucial for compliance and transparency due to the complex nature of VIEs, and the AI’s output should reflect the formal, cautious tone, emphasizing that this is common practice in restricted sectors in China and that the company has taken steps to mitigate associated risks."

      "section": "Relationship with Our Controlling Shareholders",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nIn this section, the prospectus discloses details about shareholders who will retain control after the offering and addresses any potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIdentification & control statement\n\nThe AI should identify the controlling shareholder(s) by name and stake.\n\nFor example, “Mr. Wang Ning, our founder, Chairman and CEO, will be able to exercise approximately 43.58% of the voting rights in our Company immediately following the Global Offering, and thus will remain as our Controlling Shareholder.”\n\nIf control is held through a trust or a holding vehicle, those should be named as well (e.g., “Mr. X through ABC Holding Ltd. and the XYZ Family Trust”).\n\nThe content needs to confirm these persons meet the definition of controlling shareholders under the listing rules (usually meaning 30%+ of voting power or significant influence).\n\nIndependence safeguards\n\nThen, the AI should outline measures taken to manage conflicts of interest and ensure independence of the listed company from the controlling shareholders.\n\nThis typically includes sub-sections on Independence: covering management independence, operational independence, financial independence, and an absence of competition.\n\nWhat “independence” should look like in text\n\nFor instance, the prospectus will assert that the company can operate independently of the controlling shareholder because it has its own separate business operations, separate management team, and no undue reliance on the controlling party.\n\nThe AI should enumerate these points: e.g., “We have our own independent management and administrative capabilities, and all business decisions are made by our Board and senior management. Our Controlling Shareholder does not interfere with the day-to-day operations. We have sufficient operational resources (customers, suppliers, systems) to operate without reliance on the Controlling Shareholder.”\n\nNon-competition undertakings\n\nAnother critical part is the Non-competition Undertaking: controlling shareholders typically provide an undertaking that they (and their other businesses) will not compete with the company’s business.\n\nThe AI should mention that: “Our Controlling Shareholders have provided a written non-compete undertaking in favor of our Company, confirming that neither they nor their associates will engage in any business that competes with our Group’s business.”\n\nIf the controlling shareholder does have other businesses in related fields, those should be disclosed along with why they are not in competition or how they are handled (maybe placed in a trust or carved out).\n\nConnected transactions cross-reference\n\nAdditionally, any ongoing or past connected transactions with the controlling shareholders should be cross-referenced (though details are in Connected Transactions section) – for example, leases or shared services, and how they are on arm’s-length terms.\n\nGranularity\n\nThe granularity here requires naming specific entities and individuals and giving numeric shareholding percentages to show the extent of control.\n\nIt should also clearly state the arrangements ensuring independence: e.g., any separate offices, no loan guarantees by controlling shareholder, independent access to financing, etc., as given in the prospectus narrative.\n\nThe AI should replicate any formal confirmation language from directors like: “The Directors are satisfied that our Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of our Controlling Shareholders after listing.”\n\nListing Rules reference\n\nFinally, mention compliance with Listing Rule 8.10 (which requires disclosure of competing interests): typically, “Our Controlling Shareholders have confirmed that they do not have any interest in a business that competes with ours, and if in the future there is a potential conflict, they will abstain from voting”.\n\nTone\n\nThe tone is formal and assuring, giving comfort to investors that although one party will have significant control, mechanisms are in place to protect minority shareholders and ensure the company’s decisions are made in its own best interest, not just the controlling party’s interest.\n\nThis section is critical for governance transparency, and the AI must cover all points thoroughly, following the prospectus template closely."

      "section": "Connected Transactions",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThis section discloses any transactions the company has entered into with related parties (connected persons), which typically include the controlling shareholders, directors, or their associates.\n\nCore requirements\n\nThe AI should identify each connected transaction and explain its nature, terms, and whether it will continue after listing.\n\nTypical sub-categories\n\nThere are usually sub-categories: Continuing Connected Transactions (ongoing relationships like service agreements, leases, or in Pop Mart’s case the Contractual Arrangements with the VIE) and any One-off Connected Transactions (like a pre-IPO asset purchase from a connected person).\n\nFor each, the prospectus states why it falls under connected transaction rules and what approvals or waivers are in place.\n\nConnected persons list\n\nThe content range should include a listing of who the connected persons are.\n\nFor example, it might start by naming “Connected Persons” – often repeating the controlling shareholders and any other major related parties that have dealings with the company.\n\nPer-transaction description\n\nThen, for each transaction or type of transaction, describe it: e.g., “We have leased office space from [Controlling Shareholder’s company] since 2018. This lease will constitute a continuing connected transaction upon listing.”\n\nThe key terms (lease duration, rent, whether rent is market rate) should be mentioned.\n\nVIE as connected transactions (example logic)\n\nA significant connected transaction in Pop Mart’s case is the Contractual Arrangements themselves, which are technically transactions with the VIE’s owners (who are directors and hence connected persons).\n\nThe AI should note that: “The service fees paid under the Contractual Arrangements between our WFOE and the VIE are classified as continuing connected transactions under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules. We have applied for, and the Stock Exchange has granted, a waiver from strict compliance with the announcement, circular and independent shareholders’ approval requirements for these transactions, on the basis that they are essential to our business and are on normal commercial terms.”\n\nThis highlights any waivers for connected transactions (which is common, because it’s impractical for VIE fees to require shareholder approval every year).\n\nAnnual caps and opinions\n\nFor each continuing connected transaction, if the prospectus provides annual caps (projected maximum transaction amounts for the next three years) or terms, the AI should include those data points, explaining that these caps are set based on reasonable assumptions.\n\nIt should also mention if an independent financial adviser has opined on these transactions (sometimes included in the prospectus that they are fair and reasonable).\n\nOngoing compliance statements\n\nThe section should reassure compliance: that the company will comply with applicable listing rules for connected transactions going forward – e.g., that the Audit Committee will review such transactions annually and the company will make proper disclosures.\n\nIndeed, prospectuses often contain undertakings: “Our independent non-executive Directors will review and our auditors will confirm the continuing connected transactions annually, in compliance with the Listing Rules”. The AI should echo such commitments to transparency and regulation.\n\nGranularity\n\nGranularity: each connected transaction must be clearly described by naming the connected party and the transaction terms.\n\nIf the prospectus lists them in a table or bullet format, do similarly.\n\nInclude monetary values or percentages if given (e.g., if a certain percent of an expense is paid to a related party).\n\nAlso mention if any of these will terminate upon listing or have been unwound as part of reorganization (sometimes, companies clean up certain connections pre-IPO). If none, that should be clear too.\n\nTone & typical phrasing\n\nThe tone is factual and compliance-oriented.\n\nThe AI should avoid any suggestion that connected transactions are advantageous; instead, they are disclosed for investor awareness and typically stated to be conducted on “arm’s length” or normal commercial terms.\n\nPhrases like “unduly burdensome and impracticable” might appear if explaining why a waiver from strict compliance was needed – if so, including that language provides authenticity.\n\nBy comprehensively listing and explaining these transactions, this section helps ensure all related-party dealings are transparent to investors."

      "section": "Directors and Senior Management",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nIn this section, the prospectus provides biographical and relevant information about the directors and senior management team.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe AI should structure this by grouping individuals into categories: Board of Directors (further split into Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors if any, and Independent Non-executive Directors), and Senior Management (which could overlap with executive directors if they hold management roles, plus other key executives).\n\nPer-person profile\n\nEach person’s profile should be a paragraph or two summarizing their age, current positions, experience, and qualifications.\n\nFor example: “Mr. Wang Ning, aged 33, is our executive Director, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Wang founded our Group in 2010 and is responsible for overall strategic direction and management. He has over X years of experience in the pop culture toy industry. Under his leadership, our Company has grown to be a market leader in China.”\n\nContent elements that must be included if present\n\nThis covers current role and contribution.\n\nIt should then mention past experience: e.g., “Prior to founding our Company, Mr. Wang graduated from [University] with a degree in [field] and worked at [relevant previous job]” (if the prospectus provides that detail).\n\nSimilar treatments should be given to other executive directors (COO, CFO, etc.) stating their primary responsibilities and backgrounds.\n\nINEDs and oversight\n\nFor independent non-executive directors (INEDs), describe their background: e.g., “Mr. X, aged Y, is an independent non-executive Director. He has 20 years of experience in finance and is currently a professor/served as CFO in [industry]. He provides independent oversight and chairs the audit committee.”\n\nInclude any notable positions or honors if relevant.\n\nOther executives\n\nFor senior management who are not directors (like vice presidents, general managers of divisions), provide their role and experience in a similar manner.\n\nRelationships and other appointments\n\nAdditionally, disclose any relationships among directors (if a director is related to a substantial shareholder or has family ties within management, etc., it should be stated to maintain transparency).\n\nAlso mention if any directors hold positions in other companies or organizations that are relevant (especially if they are INEDs of other listed companies).\n\nBoard capability\n\nThe section should confirm that all directors have sufficient experience and there’s a diversity of expertise on the board (often this is implicit but can be emphasized by listing various professional qualifications: e.g., someone might be a CPA for audit committee, another an attorney, etc.).\n\nService contracts / rotation\n\nThe prospectus often includes a statement that each director has a service contract and is subject to retirement by rotation according to the Articles of Association – which can be briefly noted (though details may also be in an appendix).\n\nGranularity\n\nThe granularity is moderate: it must include each person’s key personal details (full name and age), their titles, and a digest of their career highlights, but not an exhaustive CV.\n\nEducation (like highest degrees and institutions) is often mentioned for credibility, especially if from prestigious universities or relevant to their job (e.g., CFO with an MBA or CPA qualification).\n\nAny professional qualifications (CPA, CFA, etc.) or industry awards can be noted.\n\nCompliance disclosures\n\nFor compliance, any past directorships in listed companies in the last 3 years are often listed, as well as any other major appointments.\n\nIf a director has something to disclose like past bankruptcies or convictions (in most cases not, but if yes, must be disclosed), the AI should include exactly as the prospectus says.\n\nTone\n\nThe tone is positive and factual, highlighting experience.\n\nIt should implicitly give comfort that the company is led by qualified and experienced individuals.\n\nFor example, using phrases like “extensive experience in [industry]” or “instrumental in developing our business”.\n\nHowever, it should not exaggerate – stick to what the prospectus information provides.\n\nIn summary, this section should instill confidence in the management by outlining their background and competence."

      "section": "Substantial Shareholders",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThe Substantial Shareholders section lists those shareholders who hold a significant portion of the company’s shares (typically defined as 5% or more of the issued share capital) prior to or after the IPO.\n\nStandard opening statement\n\nIt usually begins with a statement: “So far as the Directors are aware, immediately following the completion of the Global Offering, the following persons will be entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, 5% or more of the voting power at general meetings of our Company.”\n\nWhat must be listed\n\nThen list the names of the substantial shareholders, and their shareholding percentages before and after the offering.\n\nFor example: “Mr. Wang Ning – approximately X% of our issued share capital immediately after Listing (through GWF Holding and Tianjin Paqu Holding Limited)”.\n\nIntermediary entities\n\nIf the shares are held through intermediary entities or trusts, those should be named and it should be explained that the individual is the ultimate owner.\n\nIn Pop Mart’s case, Mr. Wang held shares via entities like GWF Holding, so the prospectus likely lists GWF Holding (BVI company) with the percentage and notes Mr. Wang is behind it.\n\nOther substantial holders\n\nThe same goes for any co-founders or large investors.\n\nIf there were pre-IPO investors whose holdings remain above 5%, list them too (e.g., venture capital funds or strategic partners). Provide the entity name and percentage.\n\nRelationships\n\nIf any of these are also directors or connected persons, mention that relationship (though it might have been earlier, it can be cross-referenced).\n\nTypical presentation format\n\nThe section might be formatted as a table with columns: Name of Shareholder, Number of Shares, % before, % after.\n\nThe AI can describe or list in text with percentages.\n\nRelationship to controlling shareholder\n\nOften, the controlling shareholders are part of this list; their stakes have been discussed in the controlling shareholder section, but here it’s formalized with exact numbers.\n\nIt might also clarify if any substantial shareholders are part of a concert party (acting together).\n\nPublic float note\n\nThe content should also mention if the public float (shares not owned by these substantial holders or directors) will be at least the required minimum (usually 25%).\n\nUsually not explicitly written here, but indirectly obvious from percentages given.\n\nGranularity\n\nGranularity requires precise percentage figures (rounded to two decimal places typically) and the names as registered (if a trust, its name; if a company, full name).\n\nIf any substantial shareholder is an entity, sometimes a brief description like “a company incorporated in [jurisdiction]” is added.\n\nLock-up (if relevant)\n\nAdditionally, this section or an adjacent one often mentions any lock-up arrangements (e.g., controlling shareholders undertaking not to dispose of shares for a certain period post-IPO).\n\nIf relevant, the AI should include: “Our Controlling Shareholder(s) will be subject to a lock-up of X months from the Listing Date, during which they will not dispose of any Shares” (these details might be also in Underwriting section, but summarizing here is useful).\n\nUltimate control transparency\n\nFinally, it may note if any substantial shareholder is a corporate entity that is ultimately controlled by someone (for transparency).\n\nFor instance, “ABC Fund holds 6%, and its general partner is XYZ Capital, which is managed by Mr. John Doe.”\n\nTone & outcome\n\nThe tone is straightforward and factual.\n\nIt essentially informs new investors who the major owners of the company are, which is important for understanding control and potential influence.\n\nBy listing these, along with their stakes, investors can gauge the concentration of ownership post-IPO."

    {
      "section": "Share Capital",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThe Share Capital section describes the company’s capital structure and the changes to it through the offering.\n\nCore disclosures\n\nThe AI should begin with a statement of the authorized share capital and the issued share capital before the IPO, and then detail the changes after the IPO.\n\nFor instance, it will say something like: “Our authorized share capital is US$500,000 divided into 5,000,000,000 Shares of US$0.0001 each. Prior to the Global Offering, we had 124,586,515 Shares in issue. Immediately following the completion of the Capitalization Issue and the Global Offering, we will have 1,381,580,350 Shares in issue.”\n\nHow to present\n\nThe AI should present these figures, usually as a mini-table or neatly in text, to show the stepwise changes (as seen in the prospectus example where they list shares in issue before, the new shares from capitalization, new shares from the offering, and total after).\n\nCapitalization Issue explanation\n\nThe “Capitalization Issue” (or capitalisation of reserves, also known as a bonus issue or stock split allotted to existing shareholders) is a common step, and the AI must describe it: basically the company issuing a large number of new shares for free to existing shareholders to increase the share count (often to a round number) by converting share premium into share capital.\n\nE.g., “conditional on the share premium account being credited with the IPO proceeds, X number of shares will be issued and allotted as fully paid to the existing shareholders on the register as of [date] by way of capitalization of HK$Y from the share premium account”.\n\nShare rights\n\nThe section should also clarify the par value of shares and that the Offer Shares (new shares being sold) will rank pari passu with existing shares in all respects (i.e., same rights to dividends, etc.).\n\nMultiple classes / WVR\n\nAdditionally, if the company has any other classes of shares or special share structures (like dual-class stock, preferred shares, etc.), they should be described.\n\nIn our context, both Pop Mart and Li Auto were ordinary shares (Li Auto had WVR structure possibly, but as a HK listing with WVR, that might involve Class A and Class B shares – if so, describe the differences in voting rights and how many of each class).\n\nThe question specifically references Pop Mart and Li Auto, and Li Auto was a WVR company in HK (with class B shares to the founder).\n\nSo, if applicable, the AI should describe that: e.g., “Our share capital comprises Class A ordinary shares (each entitling one vote) and Class B ordinary shares (each entitling 10 votes) held by the Controlling Shareholder, to reflect a weighted voting rights structure.” And mention the numbers of each class pre- and post-IPO.\n\nOther securities and mandates\n\nThis section should also mention other securities: any options, RSUs, or convertible instruments outstanding.\n\nFor example, number of share options granted under any pre-IPO scheme, and if there’s an ESOP (employee share option pool) reserved.\n\nThe prospectus often lists the general mandates that will be sought from shareholders (e.g., a general mandate to issue shares not exceeding 20% of issued capital, and a mandate to repurchase up to 10%).\n\nThe AI can mention that in brief: “At the annual general meeting, our Directors will have a general mandate to allot and issue new shares up to 20% of our then-issued share capital, and a mandate to repurchase shares up to 10%.”\n\nGranularity and assumptions\n\nGranularity needed: exact numbers of shares and currency amounts (par value, total authorized capital).\n\nThese numbers are typically given to several decimal places or as exact figures, which the AI should mirror as seen.\n\nIf a currency conversion is used for par (e.g., US$0.0001 per share, which is common for par in a Cayman company), include that.\n\nAlso, any changes between prospectus date and listing (like if an over-allotment option could further increase the issued shares) should be noted: prospectus often says “assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised” in the calculations, and then states what happens if it is (maybe in a footnote or narrative).\n\nThe AI should incorporate that assumption language for completeness.\n\nTone & investor value\n\nThe tone is formal and precise, with a lot of numerical information.\n\nThis section reads almost like a legal statement of capital facts.\n\nIt ensures investors know how many shares exist and will exist, and thus their ownership stakes if they buy shares.\n\nBy clearly outlining the share capital before and after the offering (and the mechanics like the capitalization issue), the AI’s output helps prevent any confusion about dilution or changes in capital structure."

      "section": "Financial Information",
      "content": "Role\n\nThe Financial Information section (often essentially the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” or MD&A) provides a narrative analysis of the company’s financial performance and condition over the track record period.\n\nHigh-level structure\n\nThe AI should structure it with an overview followed by detailed discussions of income statement items, balance sheet items, liquidity, and other financial aspects.\n\nStandard opening / scope statement\n\nIt typically starts with a restatement of the scope: “The following discussion and analysis refer to our consolidated financial information for the years ended 2018, 2019, 2020 and the interim period of 2021, and should be read in conjunction with the Accountants’ Report in Appendix I” – such a preamble situates the reader.\n\nOverview of trends\n\nOverview: The AI should summarize the key financial trends – e.g., “We have experienced rapid growth in recent years. Our revenue increased from RMB X in 2018 to RMB Y in 2019, and further to RMB Z in 2020, representing a CAGR of __%. We turned profitable in 2019 with a net profit of RMB A, compared to a net loss in 2018, and our net profit expanded to RMB B in 2020.” (Using actual figures if available from the prospectus summary financials).\n\nIt also might mention key factors driving the performance (like increase in number of stores or products launched, etc., if those are quantitatively significant).\n\nRevenue breakdown\n\nThen Revenue analysis: The AI should break down revenue by segments or categories if the company does so (for example, revenue from retail stores vs. online vs. wholesale, or by product category) and discuss the growth in each, supported by percentages or amounts.\n\n“Our revenue growth was primarily driven by the success of our core character lines such as Molly, which alone contributed X% of revenue in 2019. The introduction of new IPs and expansion of our store network also boosted sales.”\n\nIf there are any one-off factors (like a promotional event or COVID-19 impact), those should be described in context.\n\nMargins and costs\n\nCost of sales and gross profit: mention how cost of sales moved and gross profit margins.\n\nE.g., “Gross profit margin improved from A% in 2018 to B% in 2020 due to economies of scale and improved product mix.”\n\nIf raw material or supplier info is relevant, note it.\n\nOperating expenses and other items\n\nOther P&L items: The AI should discuss major expenses – selling & distribution costs, admin expenses, R&D (if applicable).\n\nIf any expense item materially increased or decreased as a percentage of revenue, explain why (hiring more staff, marketing campaign, share-based payments, etc.).\n\nAlso point out if the company had any significant other gains or losses (like fair value changes, government grants, etc.).\n\nProfitability measures\n\nProfitability: If net profit or loss, and net profit margin, note those.\n\nPossibly mention EBITDA or adjusted profits if the company highlights those (some companies present a non-IFRS measure excluding certain expenses; if so, define it and provide the figure).\n\nBalance sheet discussion\n\nBalance Sheet: The AI should comment on the company’s financial position – growth in assets like how cash and bank balances have changed, any major capital expenditures (increase in PPE), inventory levels and turnover, trade receivables (and any credit risk or bad debt allowances), etc.\n\nIf the company has debt, discuss the borrowings and gearing.\n\nIf significant acquisitions happened, mention their effect on the balance sheet.\n\nLiquidity and working capital\n\nLiquidity and capital resources: Here, describe if operating cash flow is positive and sufficient, any major financing raised (like the proceeds of the IPO and how they will affect liquidity).\n\nAlso mention the working capital sufficiency statement (in HK prospectus, usually “our directors are of the opinion that, taking into account the net proceeds from the IPO and our available facilities, we have sufficient working capital for at least the next 12 months”). If given, the AI should incorporate that assurance.\n\nIndebtedness\n\nIndebtedness: Possibly list any bank loans, and whether they’re secured or unsecured, and the maturity profile.\n\nConfirm if gearing is low or high.\n\nAccounting policies and judgments\n\nSignificant financial policies: sometimes a subsection highlights critical accounting policies (like how revenue is recognized, how inventory is valued, impairment policy, etc.).\n\nThe AI can summarize: “The significant accounting policies are set out in the Accountants’ Report; key judgments include revenue recognition for blind box sales and valuation of inventory, given the need to write down slow-moving stock.”\n\nIf any changes in accounting or one-time adjustments (like conversion of preferred shares to equity) took place, mention those and their effects.\n\nRatios and operational metrics\n\nQuantitative analysis: The section might include certain financial ratios or metrics.\n\nIf the prospectus explicitly discusses things like inventory turnover days, trade receivable days, etc., the AI should reflect those (e.g., “Our inventory turnover days were 120 in 2018, improving to 90 days in 2020 due to better stock management.”).\n\nSubsequent events / post-period trends\n\nFuture outlook in financial terms: The company might mention subsequent events or known trends post-period.\n\nE.g., Covid-19 impact on Q1 2021 sales (for a 2020-year prospectus) – mention how Q1 2021 performed vs Q1 2020 if they gave numbers or commentary.\n\nOr any material subsequent events like a new financing or a significant subsequent loss/profit in the interim.\n\nGranularity and “story behind the numbers”\n\nThe granularity should be such that an investor reading it understands the story behind the numbers, not just the numbers themselves.\n\nThat means including percentage changes and reasons.\n\nFor example: “Selling and distribution expenses increased by 50% in 2019 due to the opening of 20 new retail stores and corresponding higher staff costs and rental expenses.”\n\nExceptional items\n\nIf there are any exceptional items (maybe fair value change of preferred shares, which are usually significant in pre-IPO financials of tech companies), mention how they affected profit and that those won’t recur after listing if those preferred shares converted to equity (thus cleaning up losses).\n\nLi Auto’s financials likely had such items – e.g., fair value changes of warrants or preferred shares; if Pop Mart had any fair value adjustments or share based payments, note those.\n\nNo fabrication + illustrative handling\n\nEverything should tie back to the actual figures that would be in the financial statements, citing them qualitatively.\n\nThe AI should not invent numbers, but use relative descriptions or example figures if not provided explicitly.\n\nGiven Pop Mart’s summary gave actual numbers, we can use those for illustration (like net profit from RMB1.6m to RMB99.5m, which is a fact we can cite).\n\nDividend policy\n\nIt’s also useful to mention any dividend policy if stated: some prospectuses say “we do not have a fixed dividend policy” or “we intend to distribute not less than X% of annual profit as dividend” – so include that if applicable.\n\nTone and credibility\n\nThe tone throughout is analytical and objective.\n\nIt should not be promotional; any improvements are stated with their factual cause, and any negative trends are also explained (e.g., “our net profit margin slightly decreased in the interim 2020 due to temporary logistics disruptions from COVID-19” – acknowledging downsides).\n\nThis builds trust that management is transparently discussing performance.\n\nOutcome\n\nBy thoroughly covering revenue, expenses, profits, and cash flows with explanatory context, the Financial Information section enables investors to understand the company’s financial health and viability.\n\nAll discussions should align with the audited numbers in the appendices, and the AI should ensure consistency and clarity in this critical analytical narrative."

Percentages and/or indicative amounts should be provided for each use, and the language should be practical, specific, and consistent with disclosed strategy.\n\nStrategic contextThe AI should begin with a short strategic overview explaining the overall purpose of fundraising (e.g., business expansion, R&D enhancement, capacity improvement, market penetration, international growth), ensuring alignment with the Company’s stated strategy elsewhere in the prospectus.\n\nNet proceeds baseline\n\nThe AI should state the expected gross proceeds and net proceeds (after deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses), typically referencing an assumed offer price (often the mid-point of the indicative price range) if that is the standard drafting approach.\n\nThis provides a consistent base for the allocation percentages and enables investors to understand the scale of planned deployment.\n\nAllocation categories and required specificity\n\nThe AI should list each planned use of proceeds as a separate item, and for each item provide: the percentage (and/or indicative amount) allocated, the specific implementation plan, and any basic timing or priority cues if disclosed.\n\nCommon allocation items include expansion of sales channels or store network, product development and R&D investment, capacity expansion and equipment purchases, strategic investments and acquisitions, marketing and international expansion, and general working capital.\n\nWhere the Company discloses concrete targets (e.g., number of stores to open, number of R&D hires, facility buildout milestones), the AI should include those targets in a factual manner to enhance specificity and credibility.\n\nImplementation priorities and sequencingThe AI may include short descriptions of execution sequencing (e.g., near-term vs. medium-term initiatives), ensuring each category is “actionable” rather than generic. The output should avoid vague statements that do not link to identifiable activities.\n\nAdjustment mechanism for proceeds variance\n\nThe AI should include a standard statement explaining how allocations may be adjusted if net proceeds are higher or lower than expected (e.g., due to pricing or exercise of the Over-allotment Option).\n\nThe disclosure should explain whether adjustments will be made proportionally or whether certain core priorities will be protected first, using cautious, governance-consistent language.\n\nClosing consistency statementThe AI should conclude with a statement that the proposed uses of proceeds are consistent with the Company’s long-term strategy and are intended to strengthen growth and competitiveness, while avoiding promotional exaggeration.\n\nInvestor valueBy linking fundraising amounts to specific deployment plans with clear allocation logic, this section enables investors to evaluate capital efficiency, strategic realism, and how the IPO proceeds translate into measurable business execution."

      "section": "Underwriting",
      "content": "Purpose\n\nThis section discloses the underwriting arrangements for the Global Offering, including participating underwriters, key underwriting terms, fees, conditions precedent, termination rights, and stabilisation-related provisions such as the over-allotment option.\n\nFormatThe AI should draft this section in formal legal and transactional language, using clear sub-headings and structured listing where appropriate. The emphasis should be on accuracy, completeness, and alignment with underwriting agreement terms.\n\nUnderwriters and roles\n\nThe AI should list the underwriters participating in the Global Offering and distinguish between Hong Kong underwriters and international underwriters where applicable.\n\nThe output should identify transaction roles such as Joint Global Coordinators, Bookrunners, Lead Managers, and other named underwriting parties, presenting names exactly and consistently with the prospectus style.\n\nUnderwriting commitments and scope\n\nThe AI should state that the Hong Kong Offer Shares and International Offer Shares are fully underwritten, and describe the standard “several but not joint” underwriting obligation framework (i.e., underwriters commit to take up their proportionate share but are not jointly liable for others).\n\nThe wording should make clear that underwriting provides assurance that the offer shares will be subscribed for, subject to conditions and termination rights.\n\nPricing agreement mechanicsThe AI should describe that the final offer price is to be agreed between the Company and the Joint Global Coordinators (on behalf of the underwriters) on the pricing date, typically following bookbuilding.It should include a standard statement that if the parties fail to reach agreement on pricing, the Global Offering will not proceed, using precise and formal wording.\n\nUnderwriting commissions and expenses\n\nThe AI should disclose underwriting commission rates and how offering-related expenses are borne, using the usual prospectus-level disclosure approach (commission percentage, description of reimbursable expenses, and any other disclosed fees).\n\nThe AI should not fabricate numbers; it should leave placeholders if the exact commission rate is not provided in input data, but must preserve the structure requiring such disclosure.\n\nLock-up arrangements\n\nThe AI should describe lock-up undertakings given by the Company and relevant shareholders (often controlling shareholders), stating lock-up period length and the scope of restricted disposals or issuances, and clarifying that waiver requires prior written consent of the underwriters where applicable.\n\nThe output must remain consistent with underwriting agreement terms and must not generalize beyond disclosed commitments.\n\nConditions precedent\n\nThe AI should list key conditions precedent to the underwriting agreements becoming unconditional, such as Listing approval, execution of the pricing agreement, completion of requisite filings, and satisfaction of other customary conditions.\n\nThe writing should convey that completion is conditional and that failure of conditions can lead to non-completion of the offering.\n\nTermination rights\n\nThe AI should describe the principal termination triggers allowing underwriters to terminate, typically including material adverse change, breach of representations or undertakings, major market disruption, or other specified events.\n\nThe AI should present termination triggers as clear bullet points or sub-paragraphs to improve readability, while maintaining legal precision.\n\nOver-allotment option and stabilisationIf applicable, the AI should describe the over-allotment option (greenshoe), including the maximum additional shares (typically up to 15% of the initial offering size), the exercise period (often 30 days from listing), and the exercising party (often Joint Global Coordinators on behalf of international underwriters).The output should explain that this option is used for over-allocation cover and stabilisation purposes and may affect post-offering share capital and allocation.\n\nOther key provisionsWhere relevant, the AI may mention customary indemnities, representations, and independence-related confirmations in brief, ensuring the section remains disclosure-focused rather than contractual reproduction.\n\nInvestor valueThis section provides investors with transparency on the transactional protections, completion conditions, fees, and potential post-offering stabilisation mechanisms, allowing investors to understand offering execution risk and related constraints."

      "section": "Structure of the Global Offering",
      "content": "PurposeThis section explains the overall structure, allocation mechanics, pricing process, reallocation (clawback) arrangements, investor categories, and listing/trading logistics of the Global Offering.\n\nFormatThe AI should present the structure in a logical sequence from overall offering size to tranche allocation, then pricing and conditions, and finally allocation results and settlement arrangements. The writing should be clear and explanatory, but remain formal and precise.\n\nOffering size and tranche split\n\nThe AI should state the total number of shares offered under the Global Offering and the split between the Hong Kong Public Offering tranche and the International Placing tranche.\n\nThe output should provide initial allocation percentages and corresponding share numbers, and should clearly state any assumptions (e.g., assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised).\n\nIf there are reserved shares (e.g., employee or preferential allocation), the AI should include them and specify how they fit into the overall structure.\n\nHong Kong Public Offering tranche mechanics\n\nThe AI should describe the target investor group (Hong Kong public investors) and application rules, including one application per applicant and board lot requirements (application must be in multiples of board lots).\n\nThe AI should describe the clawback/reallocation mechanism and present the reallocation thresholds and resulting tranche percentage adjustments in a clear and rule-consistent manner.\n\nThe AI should ensure the clawback structure is described in a precise tiered format (e.g., subscription multiples thresholds and the corresponding reallocation outcomes).\n\nInternational Placing tranche mechanics\n\nThe AI should describe that the International Placing tranche is allocated to professional, institutional, and other international investors, and that allocation is determined through bookbuilding and underwriter allocation decisions.\n\nThe AI should explain how the International Placing tranche size will adjust downward if clawback increases the Hong Kong tranche.\n\nIf cornerstone investors exist, the AI should state that cornerstone subscriptions form part of the International Placing and disclose cornerstone share quantities and lock-up restrictions (commonly six months), using prospectus-style language.\n\nPricing mechanism and price determination\n\nThe AI should explain that the final offer price is determined within the indicated offer price range, typically based on bookbuilding results and agreement between the Company and Joint Global Coordinators.\n\nThe output should emphasize that all investors in both tranches pay the same final offer price and should include timing references for the pricing date and announcement of results where the prospectus framework requires it.\n\nConditions for completion and refund logic\n\nThe AI should list key offering conditions, including sufficient subscription under the Hong Kong tranche, non-termination of underwriting, and listing approval.\n\nThe AI should state that if conditions are not satisfied, the Global Offering will not proceed and application monies will be refunded, using standard formal phrasing.\n\nImpact of over-allotment option on structure\n\nThe AI should explain how exercise of the over-allotment option may increase the total number of shares in issue and may affect final allocation and share capital.\n\nThe disclosure should state that the Company will announce whether the option is exercised and that post-offering share capital figures may change accordingly.\n\nAllocation basis and publication of results\n\nThe AI should explain that Hong Kong Public Offering allocations are typically determined by ballot/draw if oversubscribed, and results are published through specified channels, while International Placing allocations are determined by underwriters based on bookbuilding allocation principles.\n\nThe AI should emphasize fairness and compliance with public float requirements, referencing standard minimum public float expectations where the prospectus framework includes such statements.\n\nListing, trading, and settlement arrangements\n\nThe AI should provide listing and trading details such as expected listing date, stock code, board lot size, and settlement method.\n\nThe output should mention that shares will be admitted into CCASS and will settle through CCASS arrangements, and should clarify whether physical share certificates are issued or whether settlement is primarily electronic, consistent with the offering structure.\n\nInvestor valueBy explaining tranche structure, pricing logic, clawback mechanics, allocation process, and settlement arrangements in an accessible but precise way, this section enables investors to understand how the offering works and what determines their chance of allocation and trading readiness post-listing."

      "section": "How to Apply for Hong Kong Offer Shares",
      "content": "PurposeThis section provides procedural guidance to investors who wish to apply for Hong Kong Offer Shares in the Hong Kong Public Offering, including eligibility, application channels, payment requirements, timelines, and post-application arrangements.\n\nFormatThe AI should draft this section as step-by-step procedural instructions with clear sub-headings and numbered steps where appropriate. The language must be direct, operational, and compliance-consistent, ensuring investors can follow the process correctly without ambiguity.\n\nEligibility and basic rules\n\nThe AI should state who is eligible to apply and the basic application restrictions, including the “one application per applicant” rule and prohibitions on multiple or duplicate applications.\n\nThe output should clarify that invalid, duplicate, or ineligible applications may be rejected, and should include the common rule that an applicant and joint applicants together may submit only one application.\n\nWhere age or identification requirements are part of the standard offering documentation, the AI should state them clearly and neutrally as eligibility conditions.\n\nApplication channels overview\n\nThe AI should describe the permitted application methods and make clear that applicants should choose only one channel.\n\nTypical channels include White Form eIPO online application, CCASS (Yellow Form) application through CCASS participants or investor participant accounts, and paper application forms if applicable.\n\nThe output should clearly separate each channel and explain that using more than one channel may constitute multiple applications and may lead to rejection.\n\nWhite Form eIPO application steps\n\nThe AI should provide step-by-step guidance for White Form eIPO applications, including accessing the designated platform, entering personal details, selecting board lot multiples, arranging payment, and obtaining an application reference number.\n\nThe AI should include the opening and closing times for online application windows where such time precision is required by the prospectus framework.\n\nCCASS (Yellow Form) application procedures\n\nThe AI should explain CCASS application procedures in two common scenarios: applying through a broker or CCASS participant, and applying directly as a CCASS Investor Participant.\n\nThe output should explain that shares allotted through CCASS applications will be credited to the applicant’s CCASS account (or held in CCASS nominee form) and that physical certificates may not be issued for such applications.\n\nPayment and fee components\n\nThe AI should state that full payment is required at the time of application.\n\nThe output should describe the standard payment composition: application monies based on the maximum offer price (or as specified), plus brokerage commission and relevant transaction levies and trading fees, with the common “more paid will be refunded” logic.\n\nIf specific rates (e.g., brokerage commission percentage and transaction levy rates) are required, the AI should present them exactly as provided in input data and in the standard disclosure style, ensuring numerical accuracy and avoiding approximations.\n\nApplication timetable and key dates\n\nThe AI should present key timetable items for the Hong Kong Public Offering, including application opening time, application closing time, expected results announcement date, refund date, and share dispatch/crediting date, aligning with the offering timetable section.\n\nTime precision should match prospectus requirements, using exact date and time expressions rather than vague references.\n\nApplication form completion guidance\n\nIf paper forms are used, the AI should include brief guidance on form completion (e.g., writing names clearly, joint applicant limits, submission location and deadline).\n\nIf paper forms are not used, the AI should still ensure investors understand the accuracy requirements of application details, as errors may invalidate an application.\n\nDeclarations and undertakings by applicants\n\nThe AI should list the key declarations typically made by applicants, such as confirming they have read the prospectus, provided accurate information, made only one application, and agree to accept the final offer price and allocation outcome.\n\nThis part should be written in a formal, bullet-point style that resembles standard application declarations, keeping the language close to typical prospectus legal phrasing.\n\nPersonal data statement\n\nThe AI should include a personal information collection statement explaining how applicant data will be used for identity verification, allocation, refunds, and related offering administration, and should reference Hong Kong privacy law principles, including applicants’ rights to access and correct personal data.\n\nThe tone must be formal and compliance-focused, reflecting statutory notice style.\n\nSpecial arrangements and contingencies\n\nThe AI should describe special arrangements such as bad weather procedures (e.g., typhoon signal or black rainstorm warning), explaining how application deadlines may be extended and how announcements will be made.\n\nThe output should structure these contingencies clearly so applicants understand scenario triggers and resulting timetable changes.\n\nResults announcement, refunds, and share delivery\n\nThe AI should explain how applicants can check allocation results (e.g., publication in newspapers and designated websites, identification by partial ID codes), and how refunds are processed for unsuccessful or partially successful applications.\n\nThe AI should explain how shares are delivered: physical share certificates for White Form applicants where applicable, and CCASS crediting for CCASS applicants, with clear timing and method descriptions.\n\nThe output should remind applicants of any identification requirements for in-person collection if that option exists.\n\nTrading and post-allocation reminder\n\nThe AI should state when trading is expected to commence and remind investors that trading should only occur after results are formally announced, cautioning against speculative trading before official allocation confirmation.\n\nThe language should be short and practical, reinforcing process clarity and investor risk awareness.\n\nInvestor valueBy providing complete, step-by-step application instructions with precise deadlines, payment requirements, and post-application logistics, this section ensures retail investors can participate correctly in the Hong Kong Public Offering and understand what to expect after submitting an application."
